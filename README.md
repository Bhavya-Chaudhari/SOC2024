Hi I'm Bhavya Chaudhari a to be sophie in Electrical Engineering Department in IITBombay.
The project I am working on is about satellite image processing which includes ML and python.
It is very encouraging to work on this project because coding is something I like to learn a lot and SOC has done that.
